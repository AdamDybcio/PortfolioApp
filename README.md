# My Own Portfolio App

It may be small, only a few pages long, but I finally created my application in the form of a portfolio. The only thing that limited me was the ideas that were full but died quickly. But when going to the app:

## What I used in the application:
- simple animations, made from scratch by myself
- is responsive
- its code is quite tidy, so using widgets created by me is almost "automatic"
- because the application was supposed to be simple, I added almost nothing to pubspec.yaml

## A short video of the application:
